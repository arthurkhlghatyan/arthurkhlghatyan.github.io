Hi, my name is Arthur! I'm a Digital Nomad.

Since you are already seeing the big picture of who am I (pls do some clicks on profile description), I'm going to tell you when it all started, what I did previously, how I am making things happen now.

I'm a self-thought programmer, in-half... I discovered the world of tech at [TUMO](https://tumo.org/) when I was 14 years old. I've learned and did a lot of experimentations with HTML and JavaScript and through the time started to like web development. Shortly, it became my passion.

As you may know every(almost) skilled human is in search of a job and I'm not an exception as well. I joined [iNexxus](https://www.inexxus.com/) in 2015 as a software engineer and worked on the company's internal software which meant to improve their marketing and project management processes.

And here comes the most interesting part!

I guess you've already noticed the short paragraph describing my lifestyle in short.
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_nomad), Digital nomads are a type of people who use telecommunications technologies to earn a living and, more generally, conduct their life in a nomadic manner. Such workers often work remotely from foreign countries, coffee shops, public libraries, co-working spaces, or recreational vehicles.

Though [recreational vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_vehicle) aren't my thing, but the definition is mostly about me. After a year and a half, I started to work as a freelancer. I discovered that the freedom to manage my schedule and the projects I'm going to work on came with key benefits, which are - improved decision-making ability, productivity, and more free time to spend on hobbies.

Of course, this kind of lifestyle also has some disadvantages but I managed to find solutions for those mostly by focusing on results. That's something to keep you motivated!

Already, over 4 years(at the time of writing) I'm working on different projects, building MVPs, and learning the technologies I'm excited about. (I'll get a bit lazy here and ask you to check my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthurkhlghatyan) to see my experience and skills in detail).
Not to mention that published a piece of [open source](https://github.com/arthurkhlghatyan).

You may ask yourself - Is this guy the type of programmers who code 24/7 - (the time spent on sleeping + eating)? The answer is no. The thing that I like most is hanging out with friends in a nice lightsome cafe, also like to drink beer (Though was fun of wine a while ago :)).

So far this is it. Interested? Let's get in [touch](/contact-me).
