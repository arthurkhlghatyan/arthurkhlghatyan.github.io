I’m a Digital Nomad.</p>\n<p>Since you are already seeing the big picture of who am I (pls do some clicks on profile description), I’m going to tell you when it all started, what I did previously, how I am making things happen now.</p>\n<p>I’m a self-thought programmer, in-half… I discovered the world of tech at <a href=\"https://tumo.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">TUMO</a> when I was 14 years old. I’ve learned and did a lot of experimentations with HTML and JavaScript and through the time started to like web development. Shortly, it became my passion.</p>\n<p>As you may know every(almost) skilled human is in search of a job and I’m not an exception as well. I joined <a href=\"https://www.inexxus.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">iNexxus</a> in 2015 as a software engineer and worked on the company’s internal software which meant to improve their marketing and project management processes.</p>\n<p>And here comes the most interesting part!</p>\n<p>I guess you’ve already noticed the short paragraph describing my lifestyle in short.\nAccording to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_nomad\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>, Digital nomads are a type of people who use telecommunications technologies to earn a living and, more generally, conduct their life in a nomadic manner. Such workers often work remotely from foreign countries, coffee shops, public libraries, co-working spaces, or recreational vehicles.</p>\n<p>Though <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_vehicle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">recreational vehicles</a> aren’t my thing, but the definition is mostly about me. After a year and a half, I started to work as a freelancer. I discovered that the freedom to manage my schedule and the projects I’m going to work on came with key benefits, which are - improved decision-making ability, productivity, and more free time to spend on hobbies.</p>\n<p>Of course, this kind of lifestyle also has some disadvantages but I managed to find solutions for those mostly by focusing on results. That’s something to keep you motivated!</p>\n<p>Already, over 4 years(at the time of writing) I’m working on different projects, building MVPs, and learning the technologies I’m excited about. (I’ll get a bit lazy here and ask you to check my <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthurkhlghatyan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">LinkedIn</a> to see my experience and skills in detail).\nNot to mention that published a piece of <a href=\"https://github.com/arthurkhlghatyan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">open source</a>.</p>\n<p>You may ask yourself - Is this guy the type of programmers who code 24/7 - (the time spent on sleeping + eating)? The answer is no. The thing that I like most is hanging out with friends in a nice lightsome cafe, also like to drink beer (Though was fun of wine a while ago :)).</p>\n<p>So far this is it.
